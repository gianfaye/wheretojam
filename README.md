# Where to Jam?

A Studio Directory with React and Node

Where to Jam? is an application that allows you to look up rehearsal and recording studios by name or address, and view the details of each studio,
call, text, or email.

This app is built with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and is based from [directory-react-nodejs](https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-react-nodejs) by [@ccoenraets](https://github.com/ccoenraets).
